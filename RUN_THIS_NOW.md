# ðŸš¨ RUN THIS EXACT SEQUENCE TO TEST THE PIPELINE

## Step 1: Open Terminal 1 - Python Analysis Service
```bash
cd C:\Users\mulli\Documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
python analysis_service.py
```
âœ… You should see: "Python Analysis Engine starting on port 8000..."

## Step 2: Open Terminal 2 - GPT-OSS Server
```bash
cd C:\Users\mulli\Documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
python -m uvicorn gpt_oss_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```
âœ… You should see: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080"

**If uvicorn error**, install it first:
```bash
pip install uvicorn fastapi
```

## Step 3: Your Backend Should Already Be Running
Make sure your backend is running (npm run dev).
Check the console for: "âœ… Intelligent Analysis routes loaded successfully"

## Step 4: Open Terminal 3 - Run the Test
```bash
cd C:\Users\mulli\Documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
python comprehensive_test.py
```

This will show you EXACTLY what's working.

## Step 5: Check in Browser
Open: http://localhost:5000/api/intelligent-analysis/market-phase

You should see JSON with an "insight" field containing AI-generated text.

## If It's Working in Browser But Not Dashboard:

The frontend components ARE updated in MarketAwareness.jsx to show IntelligentAnalysis boxes.

Hard refresh your dashboard: **Ctrl+Shift+R**

## What You Should See:

In each section of your dashboard, below the charts, you should see:
- A dark gradient box with a blue shimmer line at top
- 3-5 sentences of AI analysis
- Footer showing "Enhanced AI" or "GPT-OSS" source

## If STILL Not Showing:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check Network tab for `/api/intelligent-analysis/*` calls
4. They should return 200 status with insight text
