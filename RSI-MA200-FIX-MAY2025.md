# RSI and MA200 Fix - May 2025

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully fixed the issue where RSI and 200-day moving average lines were not displaying completely across the charts. The fix involved updating both the backend and frontend components.

### Backend Changes:

1. **Created `technicalIndicators.js`** - A new utility file containing the RSI calculation function
   - Path: `backend/src/utils/technicalIndicators.js`
   - Implements Wilder's smoothing method for accurate RSI calculation

2. **Updated `eodService.js`** - Modified to calculate indicators on the backend
   - Path: `backend/src/services/eodService.js`
   - Now imports both MA200 and RSI calculation utilities
   - Calculates indicators for ALL data points (including extra historical data)
   - Properly marks data with `isDisplayed` flag for frontend filtering

### Frontend Changes:

3. **Updated `MarketMetricsCarousel.jsx`** - Fixed to handle the display flag correctly
   - Path: `frontend/src/components/MarketMetricsCarousel.jsx`
   - Now filters data based on `isDisplayed` flag
   - Shows complete indicator lines across the entire visible chart range

## How It Works

1. Backend fetches extra historical data (250 additional days) for periods < 1 year
2. Calculates MA200 and RSI for ALL data points
3. Marks which data points should be displayed based on the selected period
4. Frontend filters to show only the displayed range with complete indicators

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Test the Backend Implementation

```bash
cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
node test-indicators-implementation.js
```

This will test various symbols and periods to verify indicators are calculated correctly.

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Start the Frontend (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Verify in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Navigate to the Market Metrics section
3. Test different time periods (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 5Y)
4. Verify that:
   - RSI shows complete lines across the entire chart
   - 200-day MA shows complete lines (when enough data is available)
   - Indicators are hidden for 1D and 5D views (intraday data)

## Expected Behavior

- **1D/5D periods**: No RSI or MA200 (intraday data)
- **1M period**: RSI shows fully, MA200 may be partial (needs 200 days of data)
- **3M/6M/1Y/5Y periods**: Both RSI and MA200 show complete lines across the entire visible range

## Troubleshooting

If indicators are still not showing:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend is calculating indicators (check server logs)
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Ensure API keys are properly configured in `.env`

## Technical Details

- RSI uses a 14-day period with Wilder's smoothing
- MA200 requires at least 200 data points to begin calculation
- Backend fetches extra data to ensure complete indicator coverage
- Frontend respects the `isDisplayed` flag to show only the requested period

## Next Steps

The fix is now complete. You should see RSI and 200-day moving average lines displaying fully across all supported time frames, matching the MarketWatch example you provided.
