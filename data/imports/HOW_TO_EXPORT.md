# How to Export Portfolio Data

## 🎯 **What You Need**

You can import either:
1. **Current Positions** (what you currently own) - Easier!
2. **Transaction History** (buy/sell records) - More detailed

## 📊 **Fidelity - Export Positions (Recommended)**

### Current Positions Export:
1. Log into Fidelity
2. Go to your **Positions** page
3. Click **Download** (usually top right)
4. Choose **CSV** format
5. This gives you all holdings with cost basis

### Transaction History Export:
1. Go to **Activity & Orders** → **History**
2. Select date range (e.g., "Year to date" or "All")
3. Filter by **Trades Only** (important!)
4. Click **Download** → **CSV**

## 🏦 **Charles Schwab - Export Transactions**

### Transaction History:
1. Log into Schwab
2. Go to **History** → **Transactions**
3. Select **Date Range** (e.g., "Year to Date")
4. Filter: **Transaction Type** → Select only "Buy" and "Sell"
5. Click **Export** → **CSV**

### Current Positions:
1. Go to **Positions**
2. Click **Export** → **Download to Spreadsheet**
3. Choose **CSV** format

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Positions CSV**: Will be imported as BUY transactions with today's date
- **Transaction CSV**: Must contain actual buy/sell trades (not dividends)
- **Cost Basis**: Make sure your export includes purchase price/cost basis
- **Symbols**: Stock tickers should be standard (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)

## 🚫 **Common Issues**

1. **"No valid transactions found"**
   - You might have exported dividends/interest instead of trades
   - Try exporting positions instead

2. **Missing cost basis**
   - Some brokers require you to select "include cost basis" when exporting

3. **Wrong date range**
   - Make sure to include all your purchases, not just recent activity
