# The Fix: Stop Asking AI to Handle Numbers

Based on your screenshots, the AI is completely fabricating numbers because **you're asking it to do something it cannot do: handle numerical data**.

## The Only Solution That Works

### 1. Start the Proper Python Service
```bash
cd backend
start-proper-analysis.bat
```

This service:
- Fetches real market data
- Does ALL calculations
- Returns conclusions like "bullish phase" or "Energy leading"
- NEVER passes raw numbers to AI

### 2. Update Your Backend Routes
Edit `backend/server.js` and change line ~140:
```javascript
// Replace this:
{ path: '/api/intelligent-analysis', module: './src/routes/intelligentAnalysisRoutes.js', name: 'Intelligent Analysis' }

// With this:
{ path: '/api/intelligent-analysis', module: './src/routes/cleanAnalysisRoutes.js', name: 'Clean Analysis' }
```

### 3. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Why This Is The Only Fix

Your current approach of putting numbers in AI prompts **will never work**. It's like asking a poet to do calculus - wrong tool for the job.

**Correct Data Flow:**
1. FMP API → Real numbers
2. Python → Calculations & conclusions
3. AI → Interpretation (no numbers)
4. User → Sees both numbers and insights

**Your Current (Broken) Flow:**
1. Data → AI with numbers → Hallucination

## Test It Works
```bash
cd backend
node test-clean-architecture.js
```

This is not a configuration issue or a prompt engineering problem. It's a fundamental architectural flaw. LLMs cannot handle numbers reliably. Period.
