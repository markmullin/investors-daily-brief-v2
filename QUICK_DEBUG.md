# Fix Market Monitor and Sector Performance Issues

## Issue 1: Market Monitor Still Showing

The Market Monitor section is being rendered somewhere. Let's find and remove it.

## Issue 2: Sector Performance Not Loading

The sectors endpoint seems to be timing out. Let's check the console for errors.

## Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Clear Browser Cache Completely**:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear Storage" on the left
   - Check all boxes
   - Click "Clear site data"

2. **Hard Refresh**:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

3. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Look for any errors in the console
   - Specifically check for CORS or timeout errors

4. **Restart Both Servers**:
   
   Backend (Terminal 1):
   ```cmd
   cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\backend
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm start
   ```
   
   Frontend (Terminal 2):
   ```cmd
   cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\frontend
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Force Clear Vite Cache**:
   ```cmd
   cd c:\users\win10user\documents\financial-software\investors-daily-brief\frontend
   rmdir /s /q node_modules\.vite
   npm run dev
   ```

If the Market Monitor is still showing after these steps, it might be cached or coming from a different source. Let me know what errors you see in the console.
