# Market Metrics & Macroeconomic Fixes - COMPLETED

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Market Index Charts - Moving Averages Added
**Created:** `frontend/src/components/charts/IndexChart.jsx`
- **50-day and 200-day moving averages** now display based on timeframe:
  - **Short timeframes (1D, 1W):** Only 20-day MA
  - **Medium timeframes (1M, 3M):** 20-day and 50-day MA
  - **Long timeframes (6M, 1Y, 5Y):** 50-day and 200-day MA
- Dynamic calculation of moving averages
- Visual differentiation with dashed lines and colors:
  - 20-day MA: Blue dashed line
  - 50-day MA: Green dashed line
  - 200-day MA: Purple dashed line
- Custom tooltips showing price and all relevant MAs
- Responsive timeframe selector with 7 options (1D to 5Y)

### 2. Macroeconomic Charts - New Indicators Added
**Updated:** `frontend/src/components/MacroeconomicEnvironment/MacroeconomicEnvironment.jsx`

#### New Indicators Added:
1. **Money Market Fund Assets (MMMFFAQ027S)**
   - Added to Inflation & Money Supply section
   - Shows total assets in money market funds (billions)
   - Indicates investor preference for cash-like instruments

2. **Real Personal Income (W875RX1)**
   - Added to Labor Market & Consumer section
   - Shows inflation-adjusted income growth (YoY %)
   - Better measure of true purchasing power

3. **Updated Labor Market & Consumer Chart**
   - Changed from Unemployment vs Retail Sales
   - Now shows Unemployment vs Real Personal Income
   - More meaningful comparison of labor market health

### 3. Backend FRED Service Enhanced
**Updated:** `backend/src/services/fredService.js`

#### New Series IDs Added:
```javascript
moneyMarketFunds: 'MMMFFAQ027S'  // Money Market Fund Assets
realPersonalIncome: 'W875RX1'     // Real Personal Income (YoY % Change)
ppi: 'PPIACO'                     // Producer Price Index
```

#### Updated API Methods:
- **getMonetaryPolicy():** Now includes Money Market Funds data
- **getLaborAndConsumer():** Now includes Real Personal Income
- **getGrowthAndInflation():** Now includes PPI and M2 money supply with Money Market Funds
