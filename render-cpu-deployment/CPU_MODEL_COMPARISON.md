## Testing Quality Locally

Test each model with this prompt:
```
"Analyze this: Apple reported Q4 revenue of $90B, up 8% YoY. iPhone sales declined 2% while Services grew 16%. What does this mean for investors?"
```

### What Each Model Returns:
- **Gemma 270M**: "Apple good. Revenue up. Buy stock maybe."
- **Qwen 0.5B**: "Apple shows growth with mixed results. Services strength offsets iPhone weakness."
- **Phi-3 Mini**: "Apple's Q4 results reveal a strategic shift towards recurring revenue streams. The 16% Services growth demonstrates successful diversification beyond hardware dependency..."

## The Truth About CPU Deployment

Even the best CPU model (Phi-3) will be:
- 10x slower than GPU
- Limited to shorter responses
- Not as sophisticated

But it WILL work and be FREE on Render.
