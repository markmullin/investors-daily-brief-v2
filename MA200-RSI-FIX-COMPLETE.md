# Complete MA200 and RSI Fix Summary - May 2025

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Increased Extra Data Fetch (All Periods)
- Changed from 250 to 400 days for periods 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y
- Ensures enough trading days (accounting for weekends/holidays) for MA200 calculation

### 2. Frontend API Service Fixed
- Added preservation of `isDisplayed` flag in data mapping
- Allows frontend to properly filter data to requested time period

### 3. 5-Year Chart Specific Fix
- Backend was excluding 5Y from extra data fetch
- Changed `needExtraData` condition to include 5Y period  
- Added 4 years of extra data for 5Y (since it uses weekly intervals)
- 200 weeks of data needed for MA200 on weekly charts

## Technical Details

### The Problem Chain:
1. Backend fetched extra data but didn't preserve display boundaries → Fixed with `isDisplayed` flag
2. Frontend API stripped the `isDisplayed` flag → Fixed by preserving it
3. 5Y charts were excluded from extra data → Fixed by including them

### Data Flow:
```
Backend: Fetches extra data → Calculates indicators → Marks display range
   ↓
Frontend API: Preserves all properties including isDisplayed flag  
   ↓
MarketMetricsCarousel: Filters to show only displayed data with complete indicators
```

## Files Modified

1. **Backend:**
   - `backend/src/services/eodService.js` - Main fix for data fetching and 5Y support
   - `backend/src/utils/technicalIndicators.js` - Created RSI calculation utility

2. **Frontend:**
   - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Fixed to preserve isDisplayed flag
   - `frontend/src/components/MarketMetricsCarousel.jsx` - Updated filtering logic

## Testing Commands
