# Market Dashboard API Integration Updates

## Summary of Recent Changes (April 15, 2025)

The Market Dashboard project has been updated with several key fixes to improve API integration stability:

### 1. EOD API Variable Scope Fix

We identified and fixed a variable scope issue in the `eodService.js` file that was causing the "fullUrl is not defined" error:

- Fixed the `fullUrl` variable declaration by moving it outside of the try/catch block, making it accessible in both blocks
- Ensured proper error handling when an endpoint is not found (404)
- Verified working endpoint format mappings to handle the EOD API's endpoint structure changes

### 2. Mistral API Client Initialization Fix

We resolved the "this.endpoint.indexOf is not a function" error in the Mistral API integration:

- Simplified the MistralClient initialization to use just the API key without additional options
- Updated the API key in the .env file
- Changed the default model to "mistral-medium-latest" with appropriate fallbacks
- Added enhanced error handling and reporting for model not found errors
- Ensured proper authentication with the Mistral API

### 3. New Testing and Verification Scripts

To validate these fixes and provide easier troubleshooting, we added:

- `verify-apis.js`: A comprehensive script to verify all API connections
- Enhanced test scripts for individual API services
- Improved documentation of environment variables and configuration options

## Testing the Changes

1. Test EOD API integration:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-eod-api.js
   ```

2. Test Mistral API integration:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-mistral-api.js
   ```

3. Verify all API connections:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node verify-apis.js
   ```

## Environment Configuration

For optimal operation, ensure your .env file contains the following settings:

```
EOD_API_KEY=your_eod_api_key
EOD_API_BASE_URL=https://eodhd.com/api
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
MISTRAL_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.mistral.ai/v1
USE_MISTRAL_API=true
```

## Technical Details

### EOD API Integration

The EOD Historical Data API integration now includes:

- Multiple base URL attempts: Tries different base URLs if the primary one fails
- Endpoint format mapping: Translates between old and new API endpoint formats
- Improved error handling: Better logging and fallback mechanisms for various error types
- Circuit breaker pattern: Prevents excessive failed requests

### Mistral API Integration

The Mistral AI integration now:

- Initializes the client with just the API key to maintain compatibility with version 0.1.3
- Implements automatic model fallback if the primary model is not available
- Includes improved error categorization and handling for different error types
- Provides detailed status reporting for troubleshooting

## Fallback Mechanisms

Both services include robust fallback mechanisms:

- If the EOD API fails, the system will use cached or synthetic market data
- If the Mistral API fails, the system will provide algorithmic analysis instead
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling problematic services

## Next Steps

- Monitor API stability to ensure continued functionality
- Consider upgrading the Mistral AI client library to the latest version when available
- Add additional test coverage for edge cases and specific error scenarios
- Implement a more comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
